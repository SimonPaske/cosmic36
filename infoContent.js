Cosmic 36 is a repetition-based timing cycle designed to help you track consistency, notice feedback, and reflect clearly.

A new pattern can only be started on Day 1 or Day 18 — these are the two clean “entry points” in the 36-day rhythm.

Day 1 is the reset point: you begin from clarity, before momentum builds.

Day 18 is the mid-cycle reset: you begin again from experience, after you’ve gathered real signal.

This app shows the next valid start date so you don’t force a start on a “messy” day.

Anchor days (3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18) are action-pressure days that strengthen the pattern through repetition.

Echo days (21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36) are mirror-return days that show what came back from earlier anchors.

If you skip a crucial day, the cycle does not break — you simply lose some clarity and momentum in the feedback loop.

You can resume at any time, but for a clean restart you wait for the next Day 1 or Day 18.

Use Cosmic 36 as a calm journaling and tracking tool: repeat, observe, and carry forward only what proves real.
